# Fraud Detection Case Study
The purpose of this Case Study is to build a model that minimizes the cost of selling fraudulent tickets to events on a service like StubHub or TicketMaster. The trained model is hosted on server and makes predictions on new data pulled from the service.

Steven Becerra and I worked together on this Case Study. We split the study to where I built the model and Steven setup the server and web scraping program. The scope.md file outlines our thoughts before the case study, the eda_notes.md outlines our thoughts during it, and the presentation outlines a summary of our findings.
